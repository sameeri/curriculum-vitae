### Philosophy and Motivation

* `Kaizen` - The principle of continuous improvement

The Kaizen principle has been introduced to be my chief mentor Ray. 

### Continous Learning

To practice Kaizen, i have to adopt the path of Continuos learning.

I have an approach to learning. I like to read, gain insight by observation, experiment and study deeply.

To enable this approach, i have to have a set of supporting systems. 

Since this can be made as a list of lists, i have grouped them accordingly.

### Technical toolset exposure

Being an Engineer at Telogical has given me a unique opportunity to work with a myriad of technologies. This includes languages, thought processes, patterns, frameworks, libraries and stacks.

I consider most of these as tools. Some are best fit in some use cases, and some in others.

An amalgamation of all things gives a comprehensive overview of choosing the right tool for a given problem. `opinion`

Since this is a comprehensive list, an organized list can be found at:

### Human Principles

Owing to my cultural background and the kind of people i have in my life, over the 34 years of my life as a human being, i have had many experiences. 

A lot of my work is to deal with code and collaborating with people. Two things that are quite interesting from a philosophical approach.

I have chosen Kaizen as my mantra to life as well.

But being human, means to make mistakes. 

Although i cannot be always practicing these, they are always in the back of my head, and are the core pillars that I stand on.
