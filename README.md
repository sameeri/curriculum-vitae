### Philosophy and Motivation

* `Kaizen` - The principle of continuous improvement

The Kaizen principle has been introduced to be my chief mentor Ray. 

### Continous Learning

To practice Kaizen, i have to adopt the path of Continuos learning.

I have an approach to learning. I like to read, gain insight by observation, experiment and study deeply.

To enable this approach, i have to have a set of supporting systems. 

Since this can be made as a list of lists, i have grouped them accordingly.

### Technical Exposure

Being an Engineer at Telogical has given me a unique opportunity to work with a myriad of technologies. This includes languages, thought processes, patterns, frameworks, libraries and stacks.

I consider most of these as tools. Some are best fit in some use cases, and some in others.

### Human Principles

Owing to my cultural background and the kind of people i have in my life, over the 34 years of my life as a human being, i have had many experiences. 

A lot of my work is to deal with code and collaborating with people. Two things that are quite interesting from a philosophical approach.

I have chosen Kaizen as my mantra to life as well.

But being human, means to make mistakes. 

Although I cannot be always practicing these, they are always in the back of my head, and are the core pillars that I stand on.

* Love
* Kindness
* Patience
* Humility
* Simplicity
* Honesty
* Listening to people
* Giving support and strong encouragement for people in need
* Spirituality
* Self-Retrospection
* Observation
* Being Passionate
* Continuous pursuit of Knowledge
* 

##### People

Human beings are amazing. I love to learn from people. 

In recent times, these are some of the people i have come to know about and in love with. They are brilliant, kind and have personalities that I truly appreciate.
